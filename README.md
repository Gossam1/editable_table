# editable_table
Project Name: React TypeScript Editable Table with Customizable Autocomplete

Description:
This project is a React application written in TypeScript that allows you to create an editable table with a customizable autocomplete feature. The table consists of multiple rows and columns, and each cell can be edited by the user.

One of the key features of this project is the autocomplete functionality. When the user starts typing in a cell, the autocomplete feature kicks in and suggests values based on the value of the adjacent cell. This can be useful in scenarios where the values in one column depend on the values in another column.

The project is built using React, TypeScript, and other related libraries to ensure type safety and maintainability. It leverages the power of React components to create a dynamic and interactive table that allows for easy editing and customization.

Key Features:
- Editable table: Users can edit the content of each cell in the table.
- Autocomplete based on adjacent cell: The autocomplete feature suggests values based on the value of the adjacent cell, enhancing data entry efficiency.
- React and TypeScript: The project is written using React, leveraging the benefits of TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.
- Customization: The project provides flexibility for customization, allowing you to modify the table's appearance and behavior according to your specific requirements.
